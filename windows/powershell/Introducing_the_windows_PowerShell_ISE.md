- [The Windows PowerShell ISE](#the-windows-powershell-ise)

The Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) is a host application for Windows PowerShell. In the ISE, you can run commands and write, test, and debug scripts in a single Windows-based graphic user interface. The ISE provides multiline editing, tab completion, syntax coloring, selective execution, context-sensitive help, and support for right-to-left languages. Menu items and keyboard shortcuts are mapped to many of the same tasks that you would do in the Windows PowerShell console. For example, when you debug a script in the ISE, you can right-click on a line of code in the edit pane to set a breakpoint.
