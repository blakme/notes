"End Task" (and taskkill) appears to post a `WM_CLOSE` message to the program's windows. (The same is done when you click the Ã— "Close" button.) If the program does not exit in some time, user gets prompted to end the program forcefully.

"Kill Process" and `taskkill /f` use `TerminateProcess()`.

MSDNs **Unix Code Migration Guide** has a chapter about [Win32 code conversion and signal handling](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms811896.aspx#ucmgch09_topic3).

Although Microsoft has decided to archive this brilliant guide, it is very useful.

Three methods are described:

- Native signals
- Event objects
- Messages
