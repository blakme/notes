Generally speaking, in [lock-free programming](http://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming), there are **two ways in which threads can manipulate shared memory**: They can compete with each other for a resource, or they can pass information co-operatively from one thread to another. Acquire and release semantics are crucial for the latter: reliable passing of information between threads. In fact, I would venture to guess that incorrect or missing acquire and release semantics is the #1 type of lock-free programming error.

In this post, I'll demonstrate **various ways to achieve acquire and release semantics** in C++. I'll touch upon the C++11 atomic library standard in an introductory way, so you don't already need to know it. And to be clear from the start, the information here pertains to lock-free programming without [sequential consistency](http://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming#sequential-consistency). We're dealing directly with memory ordering in a multicore or multiprocessor environment.

Unfortunately, the terms acquire and release semantics appear to be in even worse shape than the term lock-free, in that the more you scour the web, the more seemingly contradictory definitions you'll find. Bruce Dawson offers a couple of good definitions (credited to Herb Sutter) about halfway through [this white paper](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee418650.aspx). I'd like to offer a couple of definitions of my own, staying close to the principles behind C++11 atomics:

- **Acquire semantics** is a property that can only apply to operations that **read** from shared memory, whether they are [read-modify-write](http://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming#atomic-rmw) operations or plain loads. The operation is then considered a **read-acquire**. Acquire semantics prevent memory **reordering of the read-acquire with** any read or write operation that **follows** it in program order.

- **Release semantics** is a property that can only apply to operations that **write** to shared memory, whether they are read-modify-write operations or plain stores. The operation is then considered a **write-release**. Release semantics prevent memory **reordering of the write-release with** any read or write operation that precedes it in program order.

  ![fig2](./fig/Acquire_and_Release_Semantics/write-release.png)

Once you digest the above definitions, it's not hard to see that acquire and release semantics can be achieved using simple combinations of the memory barrier types [I described at length in my previous post](http://preshing.com/20120710/memory-barriers-are-like-source-control-operations). **The barriers must (somehow) be placed after the read-acquire operation, but before the write-release**. [Update: Please note that these barriers are technically more strict than what’s required for acquire and release semantics on a single memory operation, but they do achieve the desired effect.]

What's cool is that neither acquire nor release semantics requires the use of a `#StoreLoad` barrier, which is often a more expensive memory barrier type. For example, on PowerPC, the `lwsync` (short for "lightweight sync") instruction acts as all three `#LoadLoad`, `#LoadStore` and `#StoreStore` barriers at the same time, yet is less expensive than the `sync` instruction, which includes a `#StoreLoad` barrier.

## With Explicit Platform-Specific Fence Instructions

One way to obtain the desired **memory barriers** is by issuing **explicit fence instructions**. Let's start with a simple example. Suppose we're coding for PowerPC, and `__lwsync()` is a compiler intrinsic function that emits the `lwsync` instruction. Since `lwsync` provides so many barrier types, we can use it in the following code to establish either acquire or release semantics as needed. In Thread 1, the store to `Ready` turns into a write-release, and in Thread 2, the load from `Ready` becomes a read-acquire.

![fig4](./fig/Acquire_and_Release_Semantics/platform-fences.png)

If we let both threads run and find that `r1 == 1`, that serves as confirmation that the value of `A` assigned in Thread 1 was **passed successfully to** Thread 2. As such, we are guaranteed that `r2 == 42`. In my previous post, I already [gave a lengthy analogy](http://preshing.com/20120710/memory-barriers-are-like-source-control-operations) for `#LoadLoad` and `#StoreStore` to illustrate how this works, so I won't rehash that explanation here.

In formal terms, we say that the store to `Ready` **synchronized-with** the load. I've written a separate post about synchronizes-with [here](http://preshing.com/20130823/the-synchronizes-with-relation). For now, suffice to say that for this technique to work in general, the acquire and release semantics must apply to the same variable – in this case, `Ready` – and both the load and store must be atomic operations. Here, `Ready` is a simple aligned int, so the operations are already atomic on PowerPC.

## With Fences in Portable C++11

The above example is compiler- and processor-specific. One approach for supporting multiple platforms is to convert the code to C++11. All C++11 identifiers exist in the `std` namespace, so to keep the following examples brief, let’s assume the statement `using namespace std`; was placed somewhere earlier in the code.

C++11's atomic library standard defines a portable function `atomic_thread_fence()` that takes a single argument to specify the type of fence. There are several possible values for this argument, but the values we're most interested in here are `memory_order_acquire` and `memory_order_release`. We'll use this function in place of `__lwsync()`.

There's one more change to make before this example is complete. On PowerPC, we knew that both operations on `Ready` were atomic, but we can't make that assumption about every platform. To ensure atomicity on all platforms, we'll change the type of Ready from `int` to `atomic<int>`. I know, it's kind of a silly change, considering that aligned loads and stores of `int` are already atomic on every modern CPU that exists today. I'll write more about this in the post on [synchronizes-with](http://preshing.com/20130823/the-synchronizes-with-relation), but for now, let's do it for the warm fuzzy feeling of 100% correctness in theory. No changes to `A` are necessary.

![fig5](./fig/Acquire_and_Release_Semantics/cpp11-fences.png)

The `memory_order_relaxed` arguments above mean "ensure these operations are atomic, but **don't impose any ordering constraints/memory barriers** that aren't already there."

Once again, both of the above `atomic_thread_fence()` calls can be (and hopefully are) implemented as `lwsync` on PowerPC. Similarly, they could both emit a `dmb` instruction on ARM, which I believe is at least as effective as PowerPC's `lwsync`. On x86/64, both `atomic_thread_fence()` calls can simply be implemented as [compiler barriers](http://preshing.com/20120625/memory-ordering-at-compile-time), since usually, **every load on x86/64 already implies acquire semantics and every store implies release semantics**. This is why x86/64 is often said to be [strongly ordered](http://preshing.com/20120930/weak-vs-strong-memory-models).

## Without Fences in Portable C++11

In C++11, it's possible to **achieve acquire and release semantics on `Ready` without issuing explicit fence instructions**. You just need to specify memory ordering constraints directly on the operations on `Ready`:

![fig6](./fig/Acquire_and_Release_Semantics/cpp11-no-fences.png)

Think of it as rolling each fence instruction into the operations on `Ready` themselves. *[Update: Please note that this form is [not exactly the same](http://preshing.com/20131125/acquire-and-release-fences-dont-work-the-way-youd-expect) as the version using standalone fences; technically, it’s less strict.]* The compiler will emit any instructions necessary to obtain the required barrier effects. In particular, on Itanium, each operation can be easily implemented as a single instruction: `ld.acq` and `st.rel`. Just as before, `r1 == 1` indicates a synchronizes-with relationship, serving as confirmation that `r2 == 42`.

This is actually the preferred way to express acquire and release semantics in C++11. In fact, the `atomic_thread_fence()` function used in the previous example was [added relatively late](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2633.html) in the creation of the standard.

## Acquire and Release While Locking

As you can see, none of the examples in this post took advantage of the `#LoadStore` barriers provided by acquire and release semantics. Really, only the `#LoadLoad` and `#StoreStore` parts were necessary. That's just because in this post, I chose a simple example to let us focus on API and syntax.

One case in which the `#LoadStore` part becomes essential is when using acquire and release semantics to implement a (mutex) lock. In fact, this is where the names come from: **acquiring a lock implies acquire semantics**, while **releasing a lock implies release semantics**! All the memory operations in between are contained inside a nice little barrier sandwich, preventing any undesireable memory reordering across the boundaries.

![fig7](./fig/Acquire_and_Release_Semantics/acq-rel-lock.png)

Here, acquire and release semantics ensure that **all modifications made while holding the lock will propagate fully to the next thread that obtains the lock**. Every implementation of a lock, even one you [roll on your own](http://preshing.com/20120226/roll-your-own-lightweight-mutex), should provide these guarantees. Again, it’s all about **passing information reliably between threads**, especially in a multicore or multiprocessor environment.

In a followup post, I'll show a [working demonstration](http://preshing.com/20121019/this-is-why-they-call-it-a-weakly-ordered-cpu) of C++11 code, running on real hardware, which can be plainly observed to break if acquire and release semantics are not used.
