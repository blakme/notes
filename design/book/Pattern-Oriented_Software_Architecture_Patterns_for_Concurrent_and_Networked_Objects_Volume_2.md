## Chapter 1: Concurrent and Networked Objects

### Overview

This chapter introduces topics related to concurrent and networked objects.

In the case study we focus on key patterns presented in this book that help to simplify four important aspects of concurrent and networked applications:

- Service access and configuration
- Event handling
- Synchronization and
- Concurrency
