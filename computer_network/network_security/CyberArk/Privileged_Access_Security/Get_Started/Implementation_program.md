This section provides a high-level roadmap for deploying the CyberArk Privileged Access Security Solution in organizations, based on the extensive implementation experience of CyberArk Security Services. The five-phase overview discusses recommendations for risk assessment, identification of critical controls, program and scope planning, rapid risk mitigation, program execution, and program development.

Following these guidelines, organizations can build a successful and, ultimately, mature privileged account security program.

In this section:

## [Phase 1 – Discovery and initiation](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/BestPractices/SecurityProgram-Phase1.htm?TocPath=Get%20Started%7CImplementation%20program%7C_____1)

The first phase of the program is to discover business and security requirements, analyze the risks, define critical controls and map out the high- level timelines. It is generally challenging to define what the “keys to the kingdom” in an organization are; organizations typically say “we want to secure everything.” By engaging with the trusted experts in CyberArk Security Services or CyberArk certified service partners, organizations draw from the experiences of security professionals and technical specialists who have been on the front lines of breach remediation efforts.

## [Phase 2 – Definition and planning](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/BestPractices/SecurityProgram-Phase2.htm?tocpath=Get%20Started%7CImplementation%20program%7C_____2)

The second phase of a privileged account security program is to define the scope of the project. CyberArk recommends starting with a narrow scope as trying to do too much will put the overall project success at risk. The key is to build a repeatable process using the privileged account SPRINT Framework, starting with the most critical privileged credentials, and use it iteratively. By mapping out use cases for each critical control, organizations can visualize how execution will occur.

## [Phase 3 – Launch and execution](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/BestPractices/SecurityProgram-Phase3.htm?tocpath=Get%20Started%7CImplementation%20program%7C_____3)

## [Phase 4 – Rapid risk mitigation](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/BestPractices/SecurityProgram-Phase4.htm?tocpath=Get%20Started%7CImplementation%20program%7C_____4)

In the fourth phase, organizations develop a roll-out plan, identify a small group of accounts that will be used as a “pilot,” identify (or create) a group of test accounts for each group and identify issues and update the roll-out plan as needed.

## [Phase 5 – Mature the Privileged Access Security program](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/BestPractices/SecurityProgram-Phase5.htm?tocpath=Get%20Started%7CImplementation%20program%7C_____5)
