- [REST with Spring Tutorial](#rest-with-spring-tutorial)

Building a REST API is not a trivial task - from the high level RESTful constraints down to the the nitty-gritty of making everything work and work well.

Spring has made REST a first class citizen and the platform has been maturing in leaps and bounds. With the Spring 5 release, REST is now battle hardened and fully mature.

With this guide, my aim is to organize the mountains of information that are available on the subject and guide you through properly building an API.

The guide starts with the basics - bootstrapping the REST API, the Spring MVC Configuration, basic customization.

It then dives into the more advanced areas of REST - HATEOAS and pagination, Error Handling and testing.
