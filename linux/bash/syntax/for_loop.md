## [Bash For Loop Examples](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-for-loop/)

### for loop syntax

Numeric ranges for syntax is as follows:

    for VARIABLE in 1 2 3 4 5 .. N
    do
        command1
        command2
        commandN
    done

OR

    for VARIABLE in file1 file2 file3
    do
        command1 on $VARIABLE
        command2
        commandN
    done

OR

    for OUTPUT in $(Linux-Or-Unix-Command-Here)
    do
        command1 on $OUTPUT
        command2 on $OUTPUT
        commandN
    done

### Examples

display welcome message 5 times with for loop:

    #!/bin/bash
    for i in 1 2 3 4 5
    do
        echo "Welcome $i times"
    done

bash version 3.0+

    #!/bin/bash
    for i in {1..5}
    do
        echo "Welcome $i times"
    done

Bash v4.0+ has inbuilt support for setting up a step value using `{START..END..INCREMENT}` syntax:

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Bash version ${BASH_VERSION}..."
    for i in {0..10..2}
    do
        echo "Welcome $i times"
    done

The [seq command](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-to-generating-print-range-sequence-of-numbers.html) can be used as follows. A representative example in seq is as follows:

    #!/bin/bash
    for i in $(seq 1 2 20)
    do
        echo "Welcome $i times"
    done

There is no good reason to use an external command such as seq to count and increment numbers in the for loop, hence it is recommend that you avoid using seq. The builtin command are fast.

### Three-expression bash for loops syntax

This type of for loop share a common heritage with the C programming language. It is characterized by a three-parameter loop control expression; consisting of an initializer (`EXP1`), a loop-test or condition (`EXP2`), and a counting expression/step (`EXP3`).

    for (( EXP1; EXP2; EXP3 ))
    do
        command1
        command2
        command3
    done

    ## The C-style Bash for loop ##
    for (( initializer; condition; step ))
    do
        shell_COMMANDS
    done

A representative three-expression example in bash as follows:

    #!/bin/bash
    for (( c=1; c<=5; c++ ))
    do  
        echo "Welcome $c times"
    done

### How do I use for as infinite loops?

Infinite for loop can be created with empty expressions, such as:

    #!/bin/bash
    for (( ; ; ))
    do
        echo "infinite loops [ hit CTRL+C to stop]"
    done

### Conditional exit with break

You can do early exit with break statement inside the for loop. You can exit from within a `FOR`, `WHILE` or `UNTIL` loop using break. General break statement inside the for loop:

    for I in 1 2 3 4 5
    do
        statements1      #Executed for all values of ''I'', up to a disaster-condition if any.
        statements2
        if (disaster-condition)
        then
            break                #Abandon the loop.
        fi
        statements3              #While good and, no disaster-condition.
    done

Following shell script will go though all files stored in /etc directory. The for loop will be abandon when `/etc/resolv.conf` file found.

    #!/bin/bash
    for file in /etc/*
    do
        if [ "${file}" == "/etc/resolv.conf" ]
        then
            countNameservers=$(grep -c nameserver /etc/resolv.conf)
            echo "Total  ${countNameservers} nameservers defined in ${file}"
            break
        fi
    done

### Early continuation with continue statement

To resume the next iteration of the enclosing `FOR`, `WHILE` or `UNTIL` loop use continue statement.

    for I in 1 2 3 4 5
    do
        statements1      #Executed for all values of ''I'', up to a disaster-condition if any.
        statements2
        if (condition)
        then
            continue   #Go to next iteration of I in the loop and skip statements3
        fi
        statements3
    done

This script make backup of all file names specified on command line. If .bak file exists, it will skip the cp command.

    #!/bin/bash
    FILES="$@"
    for f in $FILES
    do
        # if .bak backup file exists, read next file
        if [ -f ${f}.bak ]
        then
            echo "Skiping $f file..."
            continue  # read next file and skip the cp command
        fi
            # we are here means no backup file exists, just use cp command to copy file
        /bin/cp $f $f.bak
    done

### For loop with array elements

In this example, we use the for loop to iterate over an array of elements defined as follows:

    DB_AWS_ZONE=('us-east-2a' 'us-west-1a' 'eu-central-1a')

    for zone in "${DB_AWS_ZONE[@]}"
    do
        echo "Creating rds (DB) server in $zone, please wait ..."
        aws rds create-db-instance \
        --availability-zone "$zone"
        --allocated-storage 20 --db-instance-class db.m1.small \
        --db-instance-identifier test-instance \
        --engine mariadb \
        --master-username my_user_name \
        --master-user-password my_password_here
    done

### Loop with a shell variable

    _admin_ip="202.54.1.33|MUM_VPN_GATEWAY 23.1.2.3|DEL_VPN_GATEWAY 13.1.2.3|SG_VPN_GATEWAY"
    for e in $_admin_ip
    do
        ufw allow from "${e%%|*}" to any port 22 proto tcp comment 'Open SSH port for ${e##*|}'
    done

### Loop with a number

We can specify a range in loops as follows:

    for i in {START..END}
    do
        commands
    done
    ## step value ##
    for i in {START..END..STEP}
    do
        commands
    done
    ## example: ping cbz01, cbz02, cbz03, and cbz04 using a loop ##
    for i in 0{1..4}
    do
        h="cbz${i}"
        ping -c 1 -q "$h" &>/dev/null 
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]
        then
            echo "server $h alive" 
        else
            echo "server $h dead or can not ping."
        fi
    done

### Loop with strings

Say we have a variable named PKGS, and we need to loop through a list of strings to install those packages:

    PKGS="php7-openssl-7.3.19-r0  php7-common-7.3.19-r0  php7-fpm-7.3.19-r0  php7-opcache-7.3.19-r0 php7-7.3.19-r0"
    for p in $PKGS
    do
        echo "Installing $p package"
        sudo apk add "$p"
    done

### Command substitution

[Command substitution](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Command_substitution) means run a shell command and store its output to a variable. For example:

    up=$(uptime)
    echo "Server uptime is $up"

The for Loop argument list also workes command substitution as follows:

    for var in $(command)
    do
        print "$var"
    done
    ## example ##
    for f in $(ls /nas/*.pdf)
    do
        print "File $f"
    done

### Command-line arguments

A [command line argument](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Shell_command_line_parameters) is nothing but an argument sent to a program being called. A program can take any number of command line arguments. For example, we are going to use the grep command to search for user names in the /etc/passwd file:

    $ grep 'vivek' /etc/passwd

grep is the name of an actual command and shell executed this command when you type command at shell prompt. The first word on the command line is:

- grep â€“ name of the command to be executed.
- Everything else on command line is taken as arguments to this command.

The for Loop argument list also accpents Command-line arguments/paramenters as follows:

    ## $@ expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  ##
    for i in $@
    do
        echo "Script arg is $i"
    done

You run it as follows:

    ./script one foo bar

### Putting all together

Bash for loop is useful for automating repetitive tasks in IT. Let us see how to run a simple command (such as uptime) on multiple Linux or Unix servers:

    for s in server1 server2 server3
    do
        ssh vivek@${s} "uptime"
    done

OR combine the echo command along with [command substitution](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Command_substitution) as follows:

    for s in server1 server2 server3
    do
        echo "Server ${s}: $(ssh vivek@${s} uptime)"
    done

In this standard bash for loop example we are going to update all CentOS/RHEL based servers using the yum command or apt command/apt-get command in case we have a Debian/Ubuntu based servers:

    ## CENTOS/RHEL example (for fedora replace yum with dnf) ##
    for s in server0{1..8}
    do
        echo "*** Patching and updating ${s} ***"
        ssh root@${s} -- "yum -y update"
    done

Here is simple but useful shell script example:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Purpose: Update all my Linode servers powered by Debian/Ubuntu Linux
    # Author: Vivek Gite under GPL v2.x+
    # ----------------------------------------
    log="/tmp/apt-get.log"
    >"${log}"
    for s in ln.cbz0{1..5}
    do
        echo "Updating and patching $s, please wait..." | tee -a "${log}"
        ssh root@${s} -- apt-get -q -y update >/dev/null
        ssh root@${s} -- DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y -q upgrade >>"${log}"
    done
    echo "Check $log file for details."

### Finding ping time for multiple IP addresses

    #!/bin/bash
    ips="$(host -t a www.cyberciti.biz | awk '{ print $4}')"
    for i in $ips; do ping -q -c 4 "$i"; done
