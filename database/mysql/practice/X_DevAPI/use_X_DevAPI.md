- [Using Connector/C++ 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/connector-cpp/8.0/usage.html)

  When compiling code which is linked with the connector library statically, define `STATIC_CONCPP` macro before including Connector/C++ public headers. This macro adjusts API declarations in the headers for usage with the static library.
