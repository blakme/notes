## Kafka Basics

- In [An Introduction to Kafka](https://dzone.com/articles/a-begineers-approach-to-quotkafkaquot), developer Prashant Sharma discusses the basics of Kafka, including the fundamentals behind a messaging system, the benefits of Kafka, and key topics (topics, loge, partitions, brokers, etc.) in the platform.

- John Hammink and Jean-Paul Azar further this discussion in [An Introduction to Apache Kafka](https://dzone.com/articles/an-introduction-to-apache-kafka) and [What is Kafka? Everything You Need to Know](https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-kafka), as he dives further into the architecture and functionality behind Kafka and describes prominent use cases and common shortcomings.

- Then, check out [Fundamentals of Apache Kafka by Moritz Plassnig](https://dzone.com/articles/kafka-logs-and-the-policy-of-truth). Writer, Moritz Plassnig, offers another look into the theory behind Kafka with his discussion of combining messaging models and making use of distributed logging.

- In [Kafka Internals: Consumers](https://dzone.com/articles/kafka-internals-consumer), Arun Lingala continues our look under the hood of Apache Kafka by exploring how consumers work in the platform.

- If you're unsure if Kafka is right for your next project, read this two-part series by Vitaliy Samofal, as he compares Kafka to RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ to Redis Pub/Sub. Parts [one](https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-to-message-brokers-part-1-apache-kafk) and [two](https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-to-message-brokers-part-2-activemq-vs) can be found here and here, respectively.

## Getting Started

- Gopal Tiwari, in his article, [Setting Up and Running Apache Kafka on Windows OS](https://dzone.com/articles/running-apache-kafka-on-windows-os), gets Windows users up and running with Kafka, as he walks readers through installation, setup, running a Kafka server, creating topics, and running a test server.

- For those looking to use Scala with Kafka, Shubham has your back in his tutorial, [Apache Kafka With Scala](https://dzone.com/articles/hands-on-apache-kafka-with-scala), as he explains how to get started with the framework and a Scala project.

- In [Apache Kafka: Basic Setup and Usage With Command-Line Interface](https://dzone.com/articles/apache-kafka-basic-setup-and-usage-with-command-li), Chandra Shekhar Pandey explains basic commands that will allow readers to run Kafka Broker and produce and consume messages, topic details, and offset details.

## Kafka Producer and Consumer

- Gaurav Garg offers users [another article on Kafka setup](https://dzone.com/articles/kafka-setup) in his two-part series and then shows readers how to produce and consume records with Kafka brokers in [Kafka Producer and Consumer Examples Using Java](https://dzone.com/articles/kafka-producer-and-consumer-example).

- Go in-depth on Kafka Consumers in [Writing a Kafka Consumer in Java](https://dzone.com/articles/writing-a-kafka-consumer-in-java), as developer Jean-Paul Azar walks readers through using Java to write a consumer to receive and process records and set up logging.

  Need some help with using Kafka and Spring Boot? Be sure to give Rahul Lokurte's article, [A Tutorial on Kafka With Spring Boot](https://dzone.com/articles/magic-of-kafka-with-spring-boot).

- Appearing for the second time in this compilation is John Hammink, as he explains how to [create producers and consumers in a data stream with Kafka and Python](https://dzone.com/articles/data-streaming-made-easy-with-apache-kafka). If you hard out for a video on the topic, look no further than Shreyas Chaudharri's article, [Apache Kafka in Action](https://dzone.com/articles/apache-kafka-innbspaction).

- For all-things partitions and producers, see these pieces by Anjita Agrawal, Amy Boyl, and Sylvester Daniel, as they explain the nitty-gritty of these key concepts in Kafka in Apache [Kafka Topics: Architecture and Partitions](https://dzone.com/articles/apache-kafka-topic-architecture-amp-partitions), [Effective Strategies for Kafka Topic Partitioning](https://dzone.com/articles/effective-strategies-for-kafka-topic-partitioning), and [Kafka Producer Overview](https://dzone.com/articles/kafka-producer-overview).
