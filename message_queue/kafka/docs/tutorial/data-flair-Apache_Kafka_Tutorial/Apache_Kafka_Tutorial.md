## Kafka Basics

In [An Introduction to Kafka](https://dzone.com/articles/a-begineers-approach-to-quotkafkaquot), developer Prashant Sharma discusses the basics of Kafka, including the fundamentals behind a messaging system, the benefits of Kafka, and key topics (topics, loge, partitions, brokers, etc.) in the platform.

John Hammink and Jean-Paul Azar further this discussion in An Introduction to Apache Kafka and What is Kafka? Everything You Need to Know, as he dives further into the architecture and functionality behind Kafka and describes prominent use cases and common shortcomings.

Then, check out Fundamentals of Apache Kafka by Moritz Plassnig. Writer, Moritz Plassnig, offers another look into the theory behind Kafka with his discussion of combining messaging models and making use of distributed logging.

In Kafka Internals: Consumers, Arun Lingala continues our look under the hood of Apache Kafka by exploring how consumers work in the platform.

If you're unsure if Kafka is right for your next project, read this two-part series by Vitaliy Samofal, as he compares Kafka to RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ to Redis Pub/Sub. Parts one and two can be found here and here, respectively.
