## Kafka Basics

- In [An Introduction to Kafka](https://dzone.com/articles/a-begineers-approach-to-quotkafkaquot), developer Prashant Sharma discusses the basics of Kafka, including the fundamentals behind a messaging system, the benefits of Kafka, and key topics (topics, loge, partitions, brokers, etc.) in the platform.

- John Hammink and Jean-Paul Azar further this discussion in [An Introduction to Apache Kafka](https://dzone.com/articles/an-introduction-to-apache-kafka) and [What is Kafka? Everything You Need to Know](https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-kafka), as he dives further into the architecture and functionality behind Kafka and describes prominent use cases and common shortcomings.

- Then, check out [Fundamentals of Apache Kafka by Moritz Plassnig](https://dzone.com/articles/kafka-logs-and-the-policy-of-truth). Writer, Moritz Plassnig, offers another look into the theory behind Kafka with his discussion of combining messaging models and making use of distributed logging.

- In [Kafka Internals: Consumers](https://dzone.com/articles/kafka-internals-consumer), Arun Lingala continues our look under the hood of Apache Kafka by exploring how consumers work in the platform.

- If you're unsure if Kafka is right for your next project, read this two-part series by Vitaliy Samofal, as he compares Kafka to RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ to Redis Pub/Sub. Parts [one](https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-to-message-brokers-part-1-apache-kafk) and [two](https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-to-message-brokers-part-2-activemq-vs) can be found here and here, respectively.

## Getting Started

- Gopal Tiwari, in his article, [Setting Up and Running Apache Kafka on Windows OS](https://dzone.com/articles/running-apache-kafka-on-windows-os), gets Windows users up and running with Kafka, as he walks readers through installation, setup, running a Kafka server, creating topics, and running a test server.

- For those looking to use Scala with Kafka, Shubham has your back in his tutorial, [Apache Kafka With Scala](https://dzone.com/articles/hands-on-apache-kafka-with-scala), as he explains how to get started with the framework and a Scala project.

- In [Apache Kafka: Basic Setup and Usage With Command-Line Interface](https://dzone.com/articles/apache-kafka-basic-setup-and-usage-with-command-li), Chandra Shekhar Pandey explains basic commands that will allow readers to run Kafka Broker and produce and consume messages, topic details, and offset details.

## Kafka Producer and Consumer

- Gaurav Garg offers users [another article on Kafka setup](https://dzone.com/articles/kafka-setup) in his two-part series and then shows readers how to produce and consume records with Kafka brokers in [Kafka Producer and Consumer Examples Using Java](https://dzone.com/articles/kafka-producer-and-consumer-example).

- Go in-depth on Kafka Consumers in [Writing a Kafka Consumer in Java](https://dzone.com/articles/writing-a-kafka-consumer-in-java), as developer Jean-Paul Azar walks readers through using Java to write a consumer to receive and process records and set up logging.

  Need some help with using Kafka and Spring Boot? Be sure to give Rahul Lokurte's article, [A Tutorial on Kafka With Spring Boot](https://dzone.com/articles/magic-of-kafka-with-spring-boot).

- Appearing for the second time in this compilation is John Hammink, as he explains how to [create producers and consumers in a data stream with Kafka and Python](https://dzone.com/articles/data-streaming-made-easy-with-apache-kafka). If you hard out for a video on the topic, look no further than Shreyas Chaudharri's article, [Apache Kafka in Action](https://dzone.com/articles/apache-kafka-innbspaction).

- For all-things partitions and producers, see these pieces by Anjita Agrawal, Amy Boyl, and Sylvester Daniel, as they explain the nitty-gritty of these key concepts in Kafka in Apache [Kafka Topics: Architecture and Partitions](https://dzone.com/articles/apache-kafka-topic-architecture-amp-partitions), [Effective Strategies for Kafka Topic Partitioning](https://dzone.com/articles/effective-strategies-for-kafka-topic-partitioning), and [Kafka Producer Overview](https://dzone.com/articles/kafka-producer-overview).

## Kafka Cluster Setup

- In [this article](https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-to-apache-kafka-1), Siva Prasad Rao Janapati takes a deep dive into creating Kafka clusters using three different brokers. Additionally, he gives readers some background on Kafka's Producer, Consumer, Streams, and Connector APIs.

- Guarav Garg makes another appearance ithis compilation with his article, [How to Set Up Kafka Cluster](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-setup-kafka-cluster), in which he explains how to create clusters independent of the number of nodes necessary for your project.

- Hitesh Jethva offers another piece on clusters with [How to Configure an Apache Kafka Cluster on Ubuntu-16.04](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-configure-an-apache-kafka-cluster-on-ubuntu), which shows readers how to get started creating clusters with Kafka and the Java SDK.

## Stream Processing

- For an in-depth tutorial on Kafka's Streams API, see Satish Sharma's three-part series on real-time stream processing. In [part one](https://dzone.com/articles/real-time-stream-processing-with-apache-kafkapart), Satish goes over stream basics. He expands on this in [part two](https://dzone.com/articles/real-time-stream-processing-with-apache-kafkapart-1), as he goes over DSL terminology and transformations, while in [part three](https://dzone.com/articles/real-time-stream-processing-with-apache-kafka-part), he walks readers through setting up a single node Kafka Cluster.

- In [this article](https://dzone.com/articles/using-apache-kafka-for-real-time-event-processing), developer Amy Boyle explains how New Relic built its Kafka pipeline with the idea of processing data streams as smoothly and effectively as possible for their current scale.

- In [Creating Apache Kafka Topics Dynamically as Part of a DataFlow](https://dzone.com/articles/creating-apache-kafka-topics-dynamically-as-part-o), Tim Spann walks readers through creating Kafka Topics programmatically, as part of streaming.

## Integration, Testing, and Data Loss Prevention

- For those needing to connect their MongoDB database to Kafka, check out [this article](https://dzone.com/articles/getting-started-with-the-mongodb-connector-for-apa) by Rober Walters that explains how to use these two components (that make up the heart of so many modern data architectures).

- In Using Jakarta EE/MicroProfile to Connect to Apache Kafka parts [one](https://dzone.com/articles/using-jakarta-eemicroprofile-to-connect-to-apache) and [two](https://dzone.com/articles/using-jakarta-eemicroprofile-to-connect-to-apache-1), Otavio Santana shows readers how to securely integrate Jakarta EE and Eclipse MicroProfile and run Kafka on top of a CDI framework.

- For all of your testing-needs, here's a [great article](https://dzone.com/articles/a-quick-and-practical-example-of-kafka-testing) by Nirmal Chandra that covers fundamental aspects of declarative Kafka testing (and microservice testing involving both Kafka and REST).

- Shreya Chaudhari discusses Kafka's use of Replication Factors and In Sync Replicas to prevent data loss in the case of disk and broker failure in his article, [Apache Kafka-Resiliency, Fault Tolerance, and High Availability](https://dzone.com/articles/apache-kafka-resiliency-fault-tolerance-amp-high-a).
